Hackasaurus Beta Feedback

The in-development beta website is at http://dev.hksr.us and contains links to the latest draft of the Hacktivity Kit and the X-Ray Goggles. Collectively, these are the three main deliverables for the beta release (webpad and hackbook are still in development and won't yet be promoted directly from the website).

If you'd like to help out by filing or fixing bugs, please use our beta release dashboard at http://dash.hksr.us. Otherwise, we'd love to have your feedback on this etherpad--just find the appropriate section below and add your comments or questions there.

 * For "Isn't hacking bad?" we could provide a pointer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_%28programmer_subculture%29 or a similar page that explains the historical context of the word, etc.

 * For  "What happens when Design Jam participants share their hacked webpages  online?", Atul will give edits to Cristina/Barbara by EOD tuesday. (Atul  should also add a link to the answer in the publish dialog UI itself.)

Page 26-  Open up WebPad should have this link: http://webpad.hackasaurus.org/

Question- Hackbook and webpad are in an experimental state, is there  a way to put an asterisk to indicate that these tools are currently being developed?
