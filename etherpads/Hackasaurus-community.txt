** MEETING CANCELLED**

Hey Hackasaurs!

We're currently trying to sprint to beta for the Mozilla Festival (http://mozillafestival.org) and would love your help.

The in-development beta website is at http://dev.hksr.us  and contains links to the latest draft of the Hacktivity Kit and the  X-Ray Goggles. Collectively, these are the three main deliverables for   the beta release (webpad and hackbook are still in development and won't  yet be promoted directly from the website, though we do mention them in  the Hacktivity Kit as experimental products).

If  you could take a look at this site, play with the goggles, and/or read  through the Hacktivity Kit draft, we'd love to have your feedback on our  etherpad at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/hackasaurus-beta-feedback.

If you'd like to help out even more by filing or fixing bugs, please feel free to use our beta release dashboard at http://dash.hksr.us.

Questions on Mozilla Festival Prep/Event Flow 
 * What is happening during Mozilla Festival?  Any preparations required this week?
   * https://etherpad.mozilla.org/Hackasaurus-mozfest
 * Notes from our festival call today:
   * Birds-eye view:
     * Design Challenges
     * Learning Labs
     * Fireside Chats 
     * One-offs (Science Fair, Keynotes, Hive London Youth Space)
   * Your Session Arc
     * As you kick off, be prepared to explain your challenge in 5 minutes or less. No big lectures :^)
     * Your goal is to get folks "doing" as quickly as possible, in whatever way you think moves your challenge forward
       * Small collaborative groups beat large passive groups every time
     * Have a sense of how you will spend the 3-hour units. 
       * Will you do check-ins or updates along the way? 
       * \Will there be show and tell during or at the end
     * Things to consider as you plan:
       * Make sure you have let us know all your needs so we can be messaging the same
       * Think  through how you will adapt if the skills of folks who join your  challenge don't have the skills you are hoping to leverage?
         * If there aren't enough developers, what can non-developers do to help. 
         * If there are too many designers, how can you get them working productively
         * Do you have something "general" folks can do that is useful?
       * Model  for a range of group sizes. Think through your challenge process and  agenda for scenarios of 15, 25, 40 and 50 participants to know who
