Wishlist:
wifi
analog cheat sheets to pass our for hackasaurus
need to integrate different age groups 
sign in form on google doc/ text the mob
more planning time
how do we have a meaningful discussion about the "open web"
    ideas: explore the web collectively and come to conclusions about why the open web is    important, 3 solutions per person.
More time - we ended up with a little over an hour - could be day long or 2 day session
Real time needs to be committed to the definition of hacking
Need to have define what hacker means
What do WE think is empowering about the open web?
We need a concept as well as process pitch?
Tool wish: kid wishes that the save feature was easier.
prep checklist
pitch: kids being more engaged with the pitches. best pitch  goes onto the hackasaurus page, featuring winning hack/ gallery. 
mid jam- pair share and feedback
perhaps pitching in the middle of the jam
yak it- web service in 11.5 seconds 

Next steps: Jess pass this around
                  Jess ping group to find out what open web  means
                  Meet again in a few weeks

Participartory/ Interaction = make up different identities on the web
Q2L just had digital citizen awareness week 

DESCRIPTION:
In  this fun, hands-on  workshop, middle-schoolers use virtual x-ray  goggles to explore the  hidden programming languages fueling the  Internet. Using the Mozilla Hackasaurus toolkit,  participants work on  design challenges that empower them to "hack,"  remix and create  webpages and web identities of their own. Youth will  use a mix of  design tools, media formats and discussions about how the  web  represents and defines us as individuals to "hack" web pages of  their  own choosing. Youth will explore everything from remixing  information  sites like Wikipedia and modifying the latest news to  re-inventing  their future selves on the Internet.  

Students  will receive an introduction to the HTML  programming language, develop  an understanding of how web pages are  designed and transmitted,  discuss identity and representation on the  Internet, discover new  digital design tools, improve problem-solving and collaboration skills  and most importantly become web producers not just web consumers!

Make It or Fake It is open to learners between the ages of 12- 14 years old.
This  event is part of the New Youth City Learning Network design jam series and is collaboration between Institute of Play, Eyebeam and  Mouse.

===============================================



Title: Interaction Design Jam (in conjunction w/ Biorhythm exhibit at eyebeam)
 
Duration:  ~3 hours
 
Overview:   In this activity, participants learn how to personalize and remix  websites by hacking. Through guided exploration, discussion, and  remixing html, participants will begin to understand how the open web is  a tool for personalization, creativity and fun.

Objectives:
Participants will learn how to edit HTML through brainstorming, prototyping and iterative design;
 * Participants will discover through exploration of familiar websites, that the web is a plaform for a variety of viewpoints
 * Participants will learn the basics of HTML through use of the hacker goggles
 * Participants will learn how to change content on webpages through the use of the remix functionality of the hacker goggles
 * Participants will create a shareable artifact by using the flickr share feature of the hacker goggles.
 * Participants will create a physical artifact by using the printable hack website.

 
Materials:
 * Laptops or PCs for students or teams of students
 * Projector
 * Firefox, Safari, Chrome or IE9 browser
 * Hacker Goggles: https://secure.toolness.com/webxray/
 * Html Pad: http://htmlpad.org/


Deliverables:

By   the end of this module, participants should produce and present to  their peers a hacked website. Additionally, participants will have  shareable artifacts of digital (through flickr) and physical (through  the printable hack website) hacks.

Facilitator Procedure:

--ICE BREAKER ACTIVITY: HACK THIS DANCE--
1. Tell the participants that they are going to hack a dance.
2.  Play a familiar dance song (like the macarena, the qua qua "chicken  dance", or the superman) and demonstrate, or have participants  demonstrate the dance:

Macarena:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlzwuFkn88U
Qua Qua:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UV3kRV46Zs
Superman:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLGLum5SyKQ

3.Tell participants that they need to hack the dance, but here are the instructions to hack it:

Simple Rules for everyone:
 * Participants form a circle and a song starts playing
 * The facilitator makes a dance move 
 * Next person, clockwise,  in the circle has to hack that move or repeat it
 * If hacking the move, the person has to demonstrate the new dance move they are adding or replacing
 * Repeat mechanic till everyone at the circle has danced.

Level up: Rules, for advanced players:
 * Participants form a circle and a song starts playing
 * The facilitator makes a dance move and zaps someone across her in the circle
 * The zapped person has to hack that move or repeat it and zap someone new
 * If hacking the move, the person has to demonstrate the new dance move they are adding or replacing
 * Repeat mechanic till everyone at the circle has danced.

Uber level up: Dancers only
 * Participants form a circle and a song starts playing
 * The facilitator makes a dance move and either zaps someone across her in the circle or zooms someone next to them
 * The zapped person has to hack that move and zap someone new
 * If hacking the move, the person has to demonstrate the new dance move they are adding or replacing
 * The zoomed person has to repeat that move till they are either zapped or zoomed by someone new
 * Repeat mechanic till everyone at the circle is going crazy

4. If you have time, repeat this activity a few times.
5. Tell participants that "believe it or not, they now have all the skills needed to hack a website"
6. Ask participants if they can break down the steps that they just did to make the hacked dance.
7.Guide them to idenitfy tagging, and changing something that already existed. 
8.  After a brief discussion, explain to students that when we talk about  hacking, we mean remixing, or slightly changing something that already  exists. 
9. Using a projector and a laptop, pull up a website that you know participants will recognize- for example google or facebook
10. Demo the goggles.
11. Break down the steps after a quick review:
 * PUT ON YOUR GOGGLES
 * LOOK at the code
 * FIND THE TAGS that you want to change or replace
 * EDIT THE CONTENT
 * BUST THE HACK

-- WORKSHOP --
12. Now tell participants to try out the goggles. 
13. Let participants play around with the tools and walk around and help them.
14. After about 5 to 10 minutes, show participants how to share their hacks using the Flickr add-on using the projector
15.  Let participants continue messing around with the tools. If you notice  someone who made a particularly great hack, call it out. 

-- PRINTABLE HACK--

16.  As the workshop is coming to a close, tell participants that if they  would like to print their hacks, they can easily do so, by going to http://toolness.github.com/hackasaurus-print/ and adding the link of their flickr image. * This step may vary depending on how the printer is set up. 
17.  At the end of the class, show participants the hackasaurus website  where they can download the tools and start hacking at home.

Chris being a nerd:

Extraordinary powers, skills and/or equipment. Superhero powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Others have special weapons or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits and Green Lanternâ€™s power ring. Many characters supplement their natural powers with a special weapon or device (e.g., Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Spider-Man's webbing, Wolverine's adamantiumclaws, Daredevil's billy club, or Thor's hammer).
