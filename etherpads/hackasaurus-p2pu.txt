Concept:

We benefit from a world wide web where anyone can use, see and manipulate content on the Internet. This is a privilege that we don’t want to lose. Every so often there are things that compromise the web, such as firewalls, or blocking functionality of web browsers. This is something that can be protected — the perfect job for a team of superheroes.

Design Challenge: Create a superhero identity to protect the open web using HTML and CSS hacking skills

• Parameters:
— The superhero must have a name and visual representation
