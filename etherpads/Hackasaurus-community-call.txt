Status Update:
 * Atul- hack sharing
 * Anna
   * Editable map of hack jams around the world: http://g.co/maps/3p5e6
   * Blog post recapping last week's school hack jams: http://maban.co.uk/60
     * There were a couple of really geeky kids who had  their own servers and were totally into Mozilla stuff! (like  @LcawteWikia).
     * Kids didn't know how to copy and paste using ctrl+c and ctrl+v. We should teach this.
     * Need to add a bit about creative commons to the jam, with description/links on how to search for images.
     * More requests for programming (Next week I'm going to a workshop on making games in javascript. I could make simple games and publish them in the webpad, kids can change variables to do things like "make spaceship fly faster")
     * Ability to share and "making it stay like that" was biggest demand
     * It'd be useful to have Tear go straight to webpad, tricky to explain it.
     * Need  to either look at making the width of the dialogue box flexible, or  "ok" and "nevermind" to be on the left instead of the right so they  don't get cut off on small screens. (I've built a fix for this if Atul thinks it's a good idea)
     * Hit esc key to close dialogue box
     * Very useful where you can't accidently select the quote marks while doing something like swapping in an image
     * A little buggy on some machines. Dialogue wouldn't open or would get stuck while opening.

How can Hackasaurus use Lighthouse more effectively?
 * Main Hackasaurus Lighthouse page: 
 * http://hackasaurus.lighthouseapp.com/hackasaurus
   * @ Anna / Atul: Can we remove log-in requirement from this page?
 * Example Web Made Movies Lighthouse pages:
   * Overview pages:
     * https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284-processingjs/overview
     * https://webmademovies.lighthouseapp.com/projects/63272-popcornjs/overview
   * Milestone view:
     * https://webmademovies.lighthouseapp.com/projects/63272-popcornjs/milestones/current
 * Sample Bug
     * https://webmademovies.lighthouseapp.com/projects/63272/tickets/655-timeline-plugin-needs-a-wrapper-container#ticket-655-2
   * Tags
     * https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284-processingjs/tickets?q=tagged%3A%22parser%22
       * tagged "parser"
   * What is a bug?
     * https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284-processingjs/milestones/current
   * Using with Github
     * https://processing-js.lighthouseapp.com/projects/41284/tickets/1566-draw-anti-aliased-shapes-when-smooth-is-called
     * https://github.com/jbuck/processing-js/network
   * Why'd you choose to use Lighthouse instead of Bugzilla?
     * Bugzilla: more intimidating for newcomers. + more than people generally need
     * It's  easy for non-technical folks to file bugs. Simple, low-bar text box for  newcomers to file bugs. Then the community triages, etc., later.
     * Lighthouse: more social way to manage bugs
       * Overview page: helpful for people on the "edge" of the work
 * Overview page = almost like Facebook wall / Twitter feed showing tickets pushed through stages of development
 * Shared ticket bins. (vs. Bugzilla custom queries)
 * Milestones and completion toward milestones provide a top level view.
 * Created states that map to familiar Bugzilla states
 * Challenge: difficult to manage dependcies in Lighthouse
   * Solution: created state called "blocked"
   * 


Questions about using Lighthouse more effectively:
 * Prioritizing tickets / ticket states
   * How do you guys prioritize bugs? Do you use tags? 
     * WMM: Adopted "time-based" train-style release style
     * Created milestones by date
     * Push bugs between milestones instead of prioritizing 
       * Use community triaging / social conventions / communication 
       * Could also use tags. e.g., "blocker"
         * Like Bugzilla flags or whiteboard
   * How do you drive more community participation?
     * Frustration with Lighthouse: when you get account, it limits the number of members
     * Must get a version of Lighthouse that will allow you to grow to the number of developers you have working on the project. 
     * 50 is maximum number of developers on free account. 
     * Challenge:
       * Have to manually add developers to main account
   * Overview pages:
     * Bobby has found overview pages especially useful. Easy to manage and track progress. 
     * As alternative to drowning in bugmail. 
   * How do you make use of states and bins?
   * How do you tie open tickets into your community calls? Do you do triage in your calls?
   * When do you file a bug for a task vs. "just doing it?"
     * David: we file bugs for absolutely everything
     * A ticket saying "we need to update this documentation" / "we need to blog"
     * Not just techincal stuff -- everything
     * That way things don't get lost in emails / a sense that anyone can get involved and it stays accountable
   * Linking with GitHub
     * Possible to link directly. WMM has turned it off / doing it manually.
         * 

Tilt 3D & X-Ray Goggles mash-up
 * Blog post about Hackasaurus mashup is at http://blog.mozilla.com/tilt/2011/08/26/hackasaurus-x-ray-goggles-mashup/

 * Feedback on how Goggles currently work / bugs to file
     * e.g., http://hacks.mozilla.org/
     * If you turn Goggles on here, all nodes are shifted to the right
     * Easily fixable with node.getBoundingClientRect()
     * Please file a bug for the Goggles here:
     * http://hackasaurus.lighthouseapp.com/projects/81472-goggles/overview
   * What's been added to Tilt to better integrate with Goggles
   * How to start Tilt from Goggles
     * Easiest way: use a key combo
     * Cannot start an extension from a web page. (No way to do this whatsoever.)
     * Options
       * a) start with simple key combination in the Goggles that would open Tilt.
       * b) completely re-write Tilt in a web page. Get out of chrome environment and use HTML for it.  (but this is probably too much work)

 * New version of Tilt
   * https://github.com/victorporof/Tilt/raw/r90/bin/Tilt.xpi
     * Liked color-coding aspect of Goggles. Applied it in this later version.
     * Tree-like representation on the left shows what DOM looks like.
     * Can also customize colors. Easily change themes. Get colo-picker, create your own representations.
   * Game-like experiences / portal style transitions
     * Not sure if this can be implemented in current version of Tilt
     * Probably be best to make a new branch for Tilt
     * Add new features to Tilt which don't make sense from a developer point of view
     * Game-like experience vs. developer tool
       * e.g., de-bugging web pages
   * Next steps:
     * Blogging about the project
     * http://blog.mozilla.com/tilt/

Agenda

HTML5 Gaming & Hackasaurus Working Group

 * Quick round of introductions & context
   * 30-second intro on who you are and why you're interested in HTML5 gaming / Hackasaurus
     * David Humphrey: 
       * Tyring to find ways to build games that aren't in a box but use the web itself
       * More collaboration amongst a bunch of standlone projects.
     * Dan Mosedale:
       * long-time Mozilla hacker. Working w. David Humphrey on Paladin 3d gaming engine. Many folks working on games at MoFo / Labs, etc. Understanding of how games fit w. Hackasaurus.
     * Brett Gaylor:
       * Working on adaptation of Cory Doctorow's Little Brother. Looking for how Little Borther might fit with Hackasaurus missions. 
         * 2 separate initiatives: hybrid of comic book and WebGL. Looking to plant Hackasaurus mission.
         * Create ARG-like experiences. (Alternate Reality Games)
         * Nethernet example is close to what we're thinking.
     * Atul Varma:
       * Interested in creating good learning experiences. 
       * Using X-Ray Goggles as "controller" for a game
       * Creating API 
     * Jono:
       * Teaching P2PU course on HTML 5 game development
       * Want to reduce the barrier to entry for novice game developers
       * Especially interested in creating games that provoke creativity on the part of players instead of just asking them to do what the designer planned
       * Interested in how we can raise the next generation of hackers
     * Jess Klein
       * Main interesting in games: educational experiences. Past worked at Sesame Street for games on smart phones, etc. 
       * Also interested in ARGs. In context of Hackasaurus jams and storytelling. 
     * Geoffrey MacDougall:
       * Raising money for MoFo. Will try to find money for these efforts. 
       * Spent 10 - 15 years in games industry. MMOs. Lots of contacts in ARGs -- including Nethernet. + made one of first in-browser 3D games. Happy to make introductions.
     * Anna Debenham:
       * Interested in learning more about how kids can build games instead of just consuming them.
     * Ben Moskowitz
       * Love Hackasaurus, love games (nerd basically [proudly] )<3

       * long-time Mozilla contributor. Worked w/ various local/small tech. communities over the years.
       * interested in helping building the next community of (open) web makers. 


     * Others? Please add


 * What's in scope for Hackasaurus games? What is Hackasaurus looking for here?
   * All sugar, no medicine. Fun, self-guided game-like experiences.
   * Think and play like a hacker. Use basic HTML / CSS / Javascript to solve puzzles, move through the game and level up.
     * would be cool to break the fourth wall: if we are doing narrative games, the characters should be aware the are living on a webpage
   * "The open web is the game-space." The web as a massive Alternate Realty Game. Blur the line between reality and play. 
   * Follow an open innovation model. Focus Hackasaurus team time on Tools & Jams. Drive community participation and innovation around Games. 
     * establish APIs or documentation to challenge people to make games
     * constrain it to a type of game: social, meta, arcade...

 * Next steps and how we're going to work together:

   * 1) Hack sprint to first minimum viable game prototype
     * Aug 8 - 12 @ new Moz T.O. office
     * Scope / outcome: 
       * Prototype basic game mechanics. Whet player, game designer and developer's appetite for creating and sharing "hack mazes."
       * Concretely: 1 or 2 hack mazes. Bust a hack, open a portal to the next page in the maze. Cool, Portal-style HTML5 transitions. 
         * Have kids come in Aug 12 to test the prototype? (Matt Price may be able to help)
         * Follow best practises from Buttercamp
         * Surface as blog post and invite game designers to show up (Bobby may be able to help)
         * 

   * 2) Launch "Hack This Game" Innovation Challenge 
     * Build infrastructure for open innovation on Hackasaurus games going forward. 
     * MoJo style platform for submitting prototypes, sharing ideas & code
     * Launch publicly w. Hackasaurus Beta in Sep
     * Hack sprint at Mozilla Festival in London in November. Involve kids as co-designers
       * Constrain with SDK. 
       * 
     * How do we involve kids?
       * Run game design jams
       * Find Game On and other HTML5 games ripe for remixing
         * let kids remix the games by hacking the source
     * Share cool assets & tools for developers to play with:
       * Plug-in architecture for X-Ray Goggles (to come)
       * WebGL.
       * Tilt. For cool 3-d style transitions.
       * Popcorn.js. For cinematic cut scenes, transitions, etc.
       * Paladin? 
       * Others? Please add here.

   * 3) Clearer documentation around our thinking
     * MATT: Blog post on this meeting and thinking to date
     * MATT & ATUL: Update Hackasaurus roadmap accordingly https://wiki.mozilla.org/Hackasaurus/Roadmap
     * ATUL: Blog post on "Parable of the Hackasaurus"
     * BRETT: Follow up on possible Little Brother narrative universe / game arc
     * BRETT: Interview / bring in Nethernet people
     * BEN: Document Arcade game idea?
     * Other blog posts / documentation?

 * "Passive Multiplayer Online Game" (PMOG)
 * Arcade games. Pac Man, etc. Figure out way to adapt that for hacking pages with the X-Ray Goggles.
 * Missions and small-games. Feels like might be over-arching narratives later... but too ealry on to get there yet. Bunch of msall different experiements.

 * Paladin game sprint. To be done for Q3. Hasn't come out publicly. Looking to make public splash before too long.  Current WIP is at <https://github.com/alankligman/paladin/>.

Types of games

Interactive narrative
    -scripted
        -cyoa
        -linear..etc.
    -can be "learning experiences"
    -can be simple, like the missions/parables, or advanced
    -designer retains control/experience
    -need story designer
    -sandboxed

ARG (alternate reality games)
    -extra reality layer
    -blends real world
    -http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/nethernet.webm
    (Nethernet, Shadow Cities...)
    
Metagames
    -can the badges be the mechanic? i dont think the mechanic, but the incentive
    -what if the "game" is a social part that works by who is earning badges?
    -earning points—turn based games? can we "judge" hacks and you get points for sweet hacks
    -there are leaderboards

Arcade games
passive games—they play themselves—and you interact by changing the conditions as the "god"
    -pacman — plays itself, change a css selector to create a barrier?
    -space invaders—plays itself, change barriers by adding a div
     -maze game—you have a little mouse trying to escape or get some cheese.  he has his own AI routines but his movement is limited. You can remove  or create gates by using HTML, and when a gate is removed he will run  through. think chu chu rocket or lemmings
     -there's a 4 / 4 square grid and a timer. you control a little man  trying to escape, by pressing the arrow keys to traverse the  environment. Every 10 seconds the stylesheet cycles and half the squares  become deadly.  You need to both navigate the character and  change the  style sheet to survive.
-Tetris?
(see Pacman DS game)

Regular games that are remixable
    A game that you can remix?

What are our mechanics?
        If X-Ray Goggles is the controller...
            -remix things that exist
            -discover things that are hidden in the source
            -change CSS selectors
            -physics and other passive processes that are affected by hacking the source
            -achievements

Agenda July 12

Hackasaurus Roadmap Update
 * The path to Beta release in September
 * Working on documenting this on Hackasaurus wiki & web site now
 * Adding tickets now for the new milestone, "The First Beta": http://hackasaurus.lighthouseapp.com/projects/66492-hackasaurus/milestones/117011-the-first-beta

What's in scope for the beta release? 
 * Stable toolset with polished UX.  Stable, user-friendly versions of X-ray Goggles, WebPad and HackBook. Polished UX with consistent branding and experience across tools.
 * "Jam in a Box 1.0" complete and ready for testing. Clear step-by-step guide for hosting your own design or hack jam for kids.
 * Cleaned-up web site. Tweak Hackasaurus.org with updated copy and design. 
 * Games.  Placeholder page -- with launch of Hackasaurus Games Innovation Challenge. Invite participation and co-building in this area in particular. 
 * Establish & track clear participation metrics. Ensure we're set up to track progress and measure participation. 


 * What can Hackasaurus learn from Scratch?
   * Andrés Monroy-Hernandes from the Scratch team will be joining the call, and possibly a couple of other folks from the Scratch team that can talk about Scratch 2.0.

   * Questions
     * 
   * Notes 
     * Remixing & "how kids work on each other's work."
     * Web site design
       * Create something in scratch, then share it on the web site
       * Emphasizes kids work and graphics -- rather than on their own design elements
       * Make it easy to share stuff and get feedback from others. 

   * Major innovation for Scratch 2.0: Combine creation space and community space
     * Like moving from "MS Word" to "Google Docs"
     * Not just view and play, but see code / authoring environment right into the browser
     * Bringing authoring environment online. Less division between desktop and web site. 
     * Making it easier to browse and explore the 1.9 million projects they have
     * Many kids work really hard on a project, but disappointing when few people use it.

     * Global / localization
       * Desktop application was initially English-only. Translating not only language, but getting engine ready for localization. Engineer had to be able to ready application for scale, e.g., supporting unicode characters. 
       * Large volunteer translation community
       * Large web site translation community as well
       * Try to design for a diversity of interests and styles. e.g., for animals, dancing, clothing styles, etc. Not trying to appeal to a single interest -- diversity as a core design principle. + a metric for success. 
       * Modding Scratch. Many work on Scratch Wiki. Group or sub-teams that stick to their niche interest.

     * Diverse range of motivations
       * Art / drawing. Tool to animate their work.  See programming not as a goal, but as a way to animate their art. See it as an expression tool, not primarily a programming tool.
         * Other tools emerging: merge between processing.js and scratch. artists interested in digital art. 
       * Some move to Flash.
       * Video games. Interested in designing their own games. Explore wide range of different features.
       *

July 5 Hackasaurus Community Call is CANCELLED
 * Normal calls will resume again July 12








Agenda June 28

Boston hack jam (Nigel Jacob / Chris Osgood)
 * Boston Mayor's office interested in doing one or more HackDay-type events for highschool / middleschool students through the summer.
 * G
   * Question: What age range are we looking at? Hackasaurus is mostly focused on tweens.
 * We could have members of the Hackasaurus team come and do one or two workshops. 
 * Or train high school seniors early summer to run workshops for younger kids later in the summer.

 * Questions & next steps
   * 

Toronto hack jam
 * 1. http://publics.hackinghistory.ca/2011/06/23/digital-humanities-for-grade-6/ This  is a blog post for public consumption, on the site we use to talk about  our digital outreach programs at the History Department (U of T)
 * 2. http://clinton.hackinghistory.ca/2011/06/23/summary-links-to-student-projects/ I  wrote this for the kids & teacher in the class I worked with.  The  kids' first names are mentioned in a bunch of places on the site (which  is probably temporary -- I just set it up to have a place to store links  that the kids needed for assignments), and I haven't gotten any kind of  waivers from parents so PLEASE don't share the second link with  anyone.  It's worth looking at, though, because it contains links to the  various individual projects the kids ended up forking off of a template  page I put up on Jsbin.

 * I  think teachers (and hopefully parents) would come in droves to an event  like the one we talked about last week -- a day-long showcase of  different educational hacking projects (a HackEd Jam? HackEd Day?  I'm  terrible with  titles).  The teacher's I've spoken to all say it makes  the most sense to hold it about 2 weeks after school starts.  Definitely  looking forward to planning that if you're still up for it.

Successfully moved from Goggles to Jsbin
Teaching kids "to be hackers" rather than just "how to use this tool

 * Questions & Next Steps
   * Very interested in helping to support this. Especially if you can drive / take a lead role in organizing. 
   * How do we move from one-off jams to longer-term learning. 
     * 
   * Setting up laboratory for ongoing Hackasaurus curriculum
   * 

Chicago Hack Jams
http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/Chicago-Hack-Jacker

New locations, no plan of attacks! 
 *         Research the interest of the targeted audience.
 *         Befriend the Cybernavigators 
 *         Bite size and quick hits (halloween size treats)

Goal
 *         Supportive Points (no more than 3)
 *         Aim to fail? (Introducing the Process of Prototyping)
 *         Product! 



Hackasaurus: Computing at School event report-back (copied across from the Drumbeat call)
   * "Teaching Hackasaurus to teachers"
     * Mostly high school teachers. A few primary school teachers.
     * A few ICT consultants
       * Really popular topic, full room and people queuing out the door
       * Teachers really enthusiastic and said they'd use it in lessons
       * Collaboration theme worked well
   * Feedback from organiser: "In the "What might you do differently ..." section of the feedback form many folk mentioned "inventive ways of using the web" as something they would like to use more in the classroom."
   * Writeup: http://maban.co.uk/57 TODO: add blog to Yahoo Pipes (Can Atul help me?)
   * "Firefox on a Stick"
     * Many computers don't allow you to run programs off a USB stick
       * e.g., TedX Kids event: firewall. 
     * Proxy settings? That need to be set up in browser for educational environments. 

 * TASKS: 
   * Anna: can you create a "Hackasaurus for teachers"
   * Question for group: does draft "technical checklist / troubleshooting"
     * Piece out technical checklist and add it to wiki
         * http://etherpad.monezilla.com:9000/hackasaurus-technical-checklist
       * Need to pull from here:
         * http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/jammin
       * 


Browser address bar issues
Interesting post on how Firefox removing the http:// or even javascript injetion in the address bar might affect Hackasaurus: http://blog.babelzilla.org/2011/06/25/is-the-death-of-the-address-bar-programmed/
"the use of JavaScript in the address bar was an easy entry point to start hacking web pages"
One  of the comments: "Unfortunately, a disconnect will occur in future when  a person tries to write their first HTML code containing a link."
Shall we write a response?

Upcoming events:
 * Coding for Kids at London Hackspace http://london.hackspace.org.uk/ (date and details tba)
 * Barcamp Brighton 6 on the 10th-11th September http://2011.barcampbrighton.org/ (still organising but there will be a youth section of this)
 * Hack Jam on 8th/15th July at Citilab (Barcelona)
   * None of these events are showing up at Hackasaurus.org I
   *  haven't added mine because they haven't been confirmedW
     * What's our process for adding events to Lanyard going forward? 
       * Let's review and add in each week's call? Good idea :)
       * Anna can you own this? Yeah :p Sweet! more work for Anna. :)
       *  Log in using Hackasaurus twitter account, add the event and click "attend"

An experimental puzzle to solve using X-ray Goggles: http://netfools.com/puzzle/
    Is this useful?   Too hard?  Too easy?  Goggle the div that holds the caption for a hint. - That's awesome!

Agenda June 21

Roadmap
Atul took a bit of a vaction from work + vacation from Hackasaurus last week, so he hasn't done much work on the Roadmap since last week's meeting. :(  What are next steps on this?
 * Tools / Games / Jams
 * (would it be useful to have a glossary? and then simplify the glossary by coalescing terms, etc? maybe that is too hard-core.)

Hackasaurus Banner
For use on pages that don't share the site's navigation such as the hackbook and Web Pad
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/228132/hackasaurus/hackasaurus-header.jpg
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/228132/hackasaurus/hackasaurus-header.png
http://hackasaurus.org/hackbook/
One header to rule them them all: Anna and Jess to work on next iteration


Hackasaurus Banner / Widget for Hackasaurus Friendly Websites?
Should we try to encourage some sites to bury easter eggs in their source that can only be found with X-ray goggles?   (think XKCD tooltips).+1 
-once we grow up and have version 1.0 out
-could be a fun task for a hack jam +1 great idea
-could be fun to do if we do a world wide web scavenger hunt

Thoughts on things to do with X-ray goggle missions.  http://netfools.com/anaglyph/


Mentorship
83 people signed up (54 as mentors, 30 as mentees) from all over the world
The form: http://goo.gl/iefna
Really rubbish draft of a page on the scheme: http://scrunchup.com/mentorship/


Hackbook has shipped! :)
Hackbook now on Hackasaurus http://hackasaurus.org/hackbook (trying out the banner)
TODO: add link to hackbook from hackasaurus

Skype
Atul Skyped w/ Anna and found it to have significantly better audio quality than the regular Mozilla teleconference line. Is it possible to have meetings on Skype instead of the Teleconference?

Library Survey
James Socol and Atul are putting this together: http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/libraries Was thinking we could make a surveymonkey survey and send it to a bunch of folks we know, as well as library folks who signed up on the recruitment form of hackasaurus.org.
loving this +100000, not just for libraries. 
Let's add to "tech checklist" +1/ event kit

Atul video on X-Ray Goggles
http://videos.mozilla.org/serv/webmademovies/atultroll.webm this is so cool! :D (and terrifying)


All My Etherpads
Related but not strictly on-topic, Atul made "All My Etherpads", a simple app for keeping track of etherpads and being able to read them offline (or if the etherpad server goes down): http://etherpal.org/  You can automatically install all the Hackasaurus-related etherpads into it with this link: http://bit.ly/mq5Ruk

Hackasaurus Research Plans (Rafi)
 * Original research proposal for studying Hackasaurus and how it promotes Hacker Literacy: http://ietherpad.com/wXmjT3Zes1 Was oriented around
   * seeing how Hackasaurus helps promote understandings that the web is remixable, and potentially looking at how youth change their behavior in relation to other areas of technology/web as a result of that. 
   * gathering data that would allow iterative design processes to happen on Hackasaurus.
     * What do we want to know about Hsaurus that we don't know yet?
     * Who for? Funders? Educators? etc.
     * What kind of data would we want to collect? How would it be collected? 
       *

FOR NEXT RELEASE:

Games Page
http://hackasaurus.org/dev/games.php
 * Reduce size of photo 50%
 * https://secure.toolness.com/webxray/missions/one/  
   * Correct spelling: 
     * First page of mission. "rendezvous"  is spelled "rendevous" at the botom of the page. 
   * For "mission complete" page, change text to:
   * "Typing something that starts with javascript: into your address bar is like injecting something into the Website you’re looking at."

   * SSL warning. Investigate SSL mixed-content warning in Mission 2
   * Saving JS bookmarklet. In  Mission 2, you might want to have the kids save the JS as a   bookmarklet on the bookmarks toolbar. At Mission 3, you say "do what  you  did in Mission 2 to turn on the goggles!", but that assumes that  the JS  is still in the clipboard. Whole lot of magic there that could  go  wrong. A bookmarklet makes the goggle toggle a single-click affair.   Especially because in Mission 3 involves toggling a couple of times.
   * Ending after mission 3. Are there missions after 3? It just kind of ends there, with no next mission, and now "where to go from here!" closing text.

   * WedPad Page 
     * http://hackasaurus.org/dev/webpad.php
       * Let's hold off on this page for now. Until we can talk about how best to embed the field and javascript right in the landing page.

     * Add HackBook
     * With snippets of copy / pastable HTML code. Like "lego" you can play with in the Goggles or WebPad:
     * http://scrunchup.com/hackbook
       * Useful   to include way to collect / flag group of snippets (i.e. is there a  way  to collect and keep track of a user's desired lego pieces to snap   together) I like this idea :) Also been thinking about a way to 'live   edit' some of the bits of code like change the colours/images

     * TASK: Add Hackasaurus header to WebPad (Jess/ Anna)
     * TASK: Edit and simplify the explanation text (Jess/ Anna/ Matt)

For next week's call:
 * Explore Mentorship 
   * Find say and effective way to pair up web professionals with young webmakers

 * Explore Hackasaurus volunteer help desk
   * Hackasaurus help desk. Public chat with approved Mozilla contributors / staff in IRC on the back end. Facebook group?

Chicago HackJam:
Postponed until another Thursday. Date: x?
 * One  of the other Mentors held a panel/ youth summit on YouMedia Student  Feedback.  Same day and time as the HackJam with the student that wanted  to participate. 

Pro:
 * More involvement with DYN and Library Team
 * Students showed to be interested the Jam Session
 * Lines of communication Open
 * A Bridge to how MoZilla’s HackJam can Help DYN

Con:
It didn’t happen!

 * Malcolm
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 


Meeting format;
 * Should we have 1/2 hour dedicated to Tools + Development and the second 1/2 to Events + Curriculum?

Roadmap:
 * We should talk about a 6-month project roadmap. Putting this at the beginning of the meeting b/c we were supposed to do this at the beginning of the last meeting but somehow it got pushed to  the end, and at that point we didn't have enough time to discuss it. - Atul
   * We need to simplify this version:
     * Hackasaurus Roadmap draft --> http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/Hackasaurus-roadmap
       * Break roadmap into 4 pieces. Roadmapping: 
         * 1) Tools (Atul & others)
         * 2) Web site (Matt, Anna, Jess & others)
         * 3) Curriculum / missions (Atul & Jess?)
         * 4) Events (Jess w. Malcolm & Anna?)
       * Mapped against 
         * a) now 
         * b) 3 months 
         * c) 6 months 
         * d) 12 months 

Board Slides:
 * http://etherpad.mozilla.com:9000/Hackasaurus-board-slides
 * Do we need to add anything to these? -Atul 
   * Not yet -- Matt will produced 2nd draft and post as blog post for feedback.

Tool Update (Atul and Dan):
 * List of new features added to Goggles:
   * http://mzl.la/lTsHAX 
     * --> Atul can you create this as a blog post?
       * You could list the new features you've just added. And then use that as a springboard the questions you just mentioned around the tools roadmap going forward.
       * The questions you're raising are actually interesting analysis for the project. Would be good to surface that analysis.
       * Along the lines of: "This is where we're at now. And here are the key questions we're grappling with right now as we refine our roadmap for the next 3 to 12 months." 
         * Would be good to surface the questions you're raising:
           * What are the trade-offs we need to consider making?
           * e.g., Is sharing more important than CSS? 
           * How do we define sharing, and design and build around it in a scalable way?
         * And also: specifically highlighting areas where help / more dev resources would help us go faster. 
         * Good way to get input from key stakeholders that will help shape our roadmap. 

 * tear feature
 * data viz
 * Hacktionary
 * Mentorship scheme (if time at the end)
   * 


Event Update:
 * Digital Youth Network Jam- Malcolm http://rafikiinteractive.tumblr.com/
