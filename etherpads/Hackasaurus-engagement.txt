Hackasaurus Engagement Strategy

Challenge: We have a huge opportunity for co-development and participation with the Hackasaurus project.

1.What do we want them to do?

(a few more low bar, get ben feedback, peer assist later on)
(sort by easy to hard, maybe even put time estimate beside each)

 * Run a hack jam for youth using Hackasaurus tools
 * Write a curriculum for hacking a unique topic (ie, citizen science, game design, history)
 * Create an afterschool hackerspace for youth (1 month setup, 1 day a week ongoing)
 * User test our tools before we release them
 * Give us feedback on our tools and curriculum
 * Document success (break down in more detail. post what? post where?)
 * Become an advocate for hacking the web 
 * Teach a class on p2pu using Hackasaurus tools
 * Co-develop an online learning experience for youth
 * Attend a hack jam (3 hours)
 * Create a webcraft certification 
 * Make a webpage using HTML and CSS
 * Tell a friend about Hackasaurus
 * Prototype how to work in the open with youth
 * Bust a hack, post it to flickr, tweet it with the right tag (15 mins)

2. What motivations or incentives will get them to show up?
 * Parent who wants their child to have "digital literacy skills"
 * Youth wants to be a "hacker"
 * Youth wants to learn HTML and CSS
 * Parent who wants to support their childs enthusiasm for the computer 
 * Educator who is looking for something innovative to teach
 * A community for educators working in webmaking
 * Mozilla is a trusted name in webmaking- learning from the professionals
 * Earn a badge (or badges)
   * Badges for youth but also badges for mentoring and teaching
 * Get your work published on the internet
 * Influence how other teachers teach web literacy (by writing curriculum)
 * Show off as a teacher, be a superstar (and get noticed by your principal)
 * Be seen as cool or expert by other youth
 * Something to put on your college (or high school) application
 * Someone who wants to show the web to other people, show it's easy

3. How do we inspire this community to use the tools on a regular basis in the work that they aleady do?
 * Use their channels to publicize and ask for help
 * Make tools that are easy for anyone to use
 * Have examples that show how to be creative in different settings (museums, libraries, classrooms etc.)
   * Hackasaurus for Science
   * Hackasaurus for Poets
   * Etc.
   * Citizen X

4. (what tactics?) How do we engage a community of educators and youth to co-develop the project and make it stronger?
 * Run design challenges for youth
 * Run curriculum challenges for educators
 * Large scale Youth Hack Design jams
 * Small scale Curriculum Design Jams
 * Create a platform for sharing curriculum (OER)
 * Create a platform for sharing hacks/ responses for design challenges
 * Use the website as a way to foster community
 * Create messaging that makes community feel that they are part of a webmaking movement
 * Create professional development resources (ie. Hacktivity Kit)
 * Incentivize becoming a MoYo ambassador through a badge certification
 * Create high visibility use- case examples

5. How do we support the community (on ongoing basis) once we have warm bodies? (community management)
 * Forums/message boards
 * Online newsletter sign up
 * MoYo Ambassador program
 * Person / people to greet new comers, support them (Mark has volunteer)
