Mouse Workshop Curriculum
This is a prototype for a series of challenges to become certified to facilitate a hack jam.

For Mouse, I have scheduled 4, 4 hour sessions that I think will look like:

 * Intro to hacking, "open web" and intro to X-Ray Goggles
 * Deeper dive into HTML and CSS - design challenge
 * Facilitation and event planning- "how to run a hack jam"
 * Practice event with peers

Session 1- Monday, December 5th: 1:30pm – 5:30pm
Intro to hacking, "open web" and intro to X-Ray Goggles

Big Ideas of the Day:
 * Hacking means changing a piece of something to create something new
 * You can hack physical things- like board games or you can hack the web
 * Web designers get inspired by existing websites to come up with new ones
 * Webpages are written with HTML and styled with CSS
 * Websites are dynamic systems that are easily changeable
 * A website designer works with inter-related parts
 * The open web is a place where anyone can participate and contribute

(would it be possible to do pizza during/before this activity? not sure they will have already had lunch yes yaaaay, we'll take care of food)
1:30- 2:15- Challenge: Define Hacking
 * (15 mins) Mindmapping activity:what words come to mind when you think of the word "hack"? Collaboratively create a mindmap- save to bring out on the last day of workshop
 * (30 mins) Beak into teams and create a tweetable definition of hacking
   * Parameters: 
     * must have back up references:
       * 3 positive articles/ web assets from reliable sources
       * 3 negative articles/ web assets from reliable sources
   * Discussion

2:15- 3:15 Challenge: Hack a Board game/ or Hack a robot dance/ or Hack the game Maffia (hack robot dance described but board game/maffia is similar- although takes longer to do)
 * The goal of this activity is for learners to understand that hacking has always been a key element in the creative process, and that it is a constructive collaborative activity, not a destructive one. Participants will learn how to hack a popular dance from the 80s to design a brand new dance.
 * How to play
   * Participants form a circle
   * Play the “How To Do The Robot (Totally Rad 80’s Dances)” video
   * Facilitator tells the group that they are now going to hack the dance, starting with examining all of the steps in the dance
   * Everyone practices the dance in its entirety
   * The first participant finds one step of the dance to change
   * The participant demonstrates the hacked dance in the circle
   * The person to the left of the initial hacker must hack that move or repeat it
   *  If hacking the move, the person has to demonstrate the new dance move they are adding or replacing
   * Repeat until everyone in the circle has danced
   * When the last person in the circle has made their hack, everyone in the whole circle needs to try out the new dance. 

 *  Discussion
   * After the dance party is over, direct guiding questions to participants to help identify the stepsto hacking. Write definition/key words that participants come up with on the board/poster paper.
     * How did you hack the dance? Discuss the rules — what were they?
     * What made the dance fun? Discuss creativity and co-developing the project.
     * What actions were you doing while hacking?
     * Discuss the mechanics and dynamic systems — Break down the activity, first they looked at the dance, then they changed bits and pieces of it until it became a new dance. One person made a change which affected the entire dance.
     * What was the goal of the activity?Discuss goal — creating a new dance by hacking
     * How do you think hacking a dance will be similar to hacking a website?

3:15- 3:30- BREAK

3:30- 4:00  Open Web Overview
 * Fill in the blanks (index cards- save for day 2):
   * I think that ___________ makes the web special
   * I think that ____________ makes the web difficult to use.
 * Discuss what makes the web unique:
   * Participation/Community
   * Contribution
 * Show "View Source" and explain that the web was created so that anyone can see how it was made and remix that content

4:00- 4:15 Challenge: Hack your first Webpage
 * Step 1: Install Goggles
 * Step 2: Turn on goggles to inspect webpages- have participants try to guess what element tags mean
 * Step 3: Remix a <p> tag 
 * Step 4: Share hacks

4:15- 5:00 Challenge: Choose any webpage to hack
At the end of the session- we have to guess what page you hacked so try to change as many things as possible including:
 * <img> tags
 * <p>
 * <style>
Distribute cheat sheets

5:00- 5:30 Shareout and overview of gameplan for next 3 sessions
<3 this workshop.


Session 2- Wednesday, December 7th: 1:30pm – 5:30pm
Deeper dive into HTML and CSS - design challenge

Big Ideas of the Day:
 * HTML is a language used to tell computers how to build webpages so that humans can consume them
 * CSS means cascading style sheets
 * Parts of a webpage include HTML, CSS, graphic assets and text content
 * The combination of an opening tag and its corresponding closing tag and the content in between is called an element
 * It is important to write code following standards so that it is accessible to different kinds of users
 * There are resources on the web for webmaking


1:30- 2:30 Challenge: Create a Superhero of the Open Web 
 * Go back to your I think __________ makes the web special/ difficult to use cards and choose one card which will be the aspect of the web you are going to defend or compete against
 * 5 minute activity: bio for your superhero
   * turn to your partner and come up with a nemesis

 * Create a superhero identity to protect the open web:
   * Parameters:
     * The superhero must have a name and visual representation
     * The superhero must have a biography
     * What are his/her superpowers?
     * How did he/she get them?
     * How do his/her superpowers help to protect the web?
     * Does the superhero have a nemesis or face a particular challenge?
     * Hack into a news site using the Goggles to write a story about how the character saved or protected the open web
     * Put the content on a webpage that was created or hacked and present it to the group at the end of the day.

Superhero Pitch presentations: show us your superheroes.... 
Discussion: 
 * What ingredients make up a webpage?
 * Draw out a wireframe
 * Parts of a webpage include HTML, CSS, graphic assets and text content
 * When writing HTML, what makes up an element?
   * The combination of an opening tag and its corresponding closing tag and the content in between is called an element

 * Do a group critique

5:00  Bonus Challenge: Create a Webpage for a vision impaired user (if we have time- otherwise move to a special session)

A vision impaired user has to use a screen reader to "view" a webpage. Let's take a few minutes to check out what a screen reader does. 

Discussion: 
 * What do you think about the screen reader?
 * How would you go about designing a website for a visually impaired user?
 * How would you change your current webpages to accommodate that user?
 * What are web standards?
 * Why are they important?




(did we already tell you that their Legacy Projects this year will be tech for the blind/visually impaired?? if not, that this is a pretty crazy coincidence NOOOO so cool! yah, last night we visited the Visions center for the blind and took a tour/met some teens who go there, they are super pumped to design for this community. anyway, yay. WOW ive never tried this before so its a bit of an experiment, hooray for the unknown. :) )


Session 3- Friday, December 9th: 1:30pm – 5:30pm
How to run a hack jam

Big Ideas of the Day:
 * A Hack Jam is an event where people collaborate to make stuff for the web
 * When planning an event you should choose a theme and set learning goals
 * To design a lesson or event plan you need to break down the learning goals into steps
 * Running an event means accounting for all the details
 * Working in the open means collaborating and sharing your process and products

Facilitation Overview:
 * Overview of TASC
 * Print out of the 5 Steps to running an event
 * Event planning: 
   * Overview of the 5 steps to a successful jam (Hacktivity Kit)
   * As a group, discuss the logistics that we know about the event at Mouse
     * How many people?
     * Where will it be held?
     * What is the duration of the event?
     * Has the event already been publicized? If so how?
     * Is there a sign up?
       * eventbrite?
       * lanyrd
     * Discuss what the theme for the event could be 
     * Discuss taking on different kinds of roles for the event
       * MC's
       * Activity Coordinator: Ice breaker

     * What is Hackasaurus?
       * Guide them to look at the talking points in Hacktivity Kit
     * What is special about the web- and why you should learn to code?
       * Guide them to look at slide show on Hackasaurus site
   * We are going to film you.

Challenge: Create an ice breaker with the "power up cards" (similar to the grow-a-game deck? yes)
cards:
 * goal
 * mechanic
 * concept
 * Goal: to teach what we mean by hacking
 * 
Challenge: create event plans 
 * same concept as the icebreaker development


Challenge: Plan the MOUSE Hacking for the Holidays Event (Hacky Holidays)/ merry hacksmus, happy hacknukkah, etc 
 * Come up with an event plan

Practice talking and doing a dry run


Session 4- Monday, December 12th: 1:30pm – 6:00pm
Practice event with peers
2:00- 4:00- prep for jam
 * Tech Setup
 * Practice Run
 * Feedback
4:00- 6:00- Hacking for the Holidays hack jam at Mouse HQ
post jam debrief- review the mindmap
talk about what went well and what didn't go so well in the jam
talk about next steps:
 * blog
 * their role as moyo ambassadors
 * 

We will recruit our other mouse corps youth on the Tuesday before, I'm hopeful most of them will want to come. "Mozilla" is so geek-cool to our kids :) thats great. plus part of the plan for session 3 is to publicize, if for some reason, a large bunch of our students know in advance that they aren't free on Monday, we can probably round up some MOUSE staff (most of whom know nothin' about html) I know it is not ideal, but a possible backup.  OR we could have them recruit their siblings? Yeah - we could also put a call out to the Hive if need be
